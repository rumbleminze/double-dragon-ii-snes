Double Dragon II SNES Port - V 1.0

This is a 1:1 port of the NES version of Double Dragon II, running on the SNES. It is utilizing FastROM/HiROM.

This has been tested in Mesen2, MiSTer, on original hardware via FxPak Pro, as well as a physical cart using a MouseBite Labs board.

Additional Features
--------------------
MSU-1 Audio music is supported.  If your platform supports MSU-1 Audio, there is an included pack available.

You can press SELECT on the opintro tions screen to preview all the MSU-1 tracks and individually turn them off, if you prefer the 2A03 music.

The "A" button will act as if you pressed both B and Y, which will act as a jump button

Additionally, the following Quality of Life options are available:
1. The continue code is not required to continue
2. The game can be completed on all difficulty levels
3. The title screen palettes have been updated (which feels like a bug in the original game to me)
4. If you need some help, feel free to pause the game and ask Lance and Bill for some extra lives.
